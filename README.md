I have recently completed my Computer Programming diploma at Niagara College Toronto and am actively seeking opportunities as a Data Analyst. With a strong foundation in data management, analysis, and visualization, I am eager to apply my technical and analytical skills to drive data-driven decision-making.

Throughout my studies, I have gained hands-on experience working with SQL, Python, Power BI, Excel, and NoSQL databases. My knowledge extends to data cleaning, querying, visualization, and statistical analysis, which enables me to transform raw data into actionable insights.

Additionally, my background in C#, Entity Framework, and JavaScript has strengthened my problem-solving approach, allowing me to work effectively with diverse data environments and support business intelligence initiatives.

Beyond my technical skills, I bring strong attention to detail, problem-solving abilities, and effective communication, developed through both my academic projects and professional experience as a concierge/security guard.
